		  <h3><u>Surgical moments :-</u></h3 >
		  <p>Mahatma Gandhi's life involved several critical "surgical moments," which refers to decisive and transformative events that
		     significantly impacted his leadership and the Indian independence movement. Some of the most pivotal moments include:
		  <li><b>Experience in South Africa (1893-1915):</b>
              First Protest (1893): In South Africa, Gandhi faced racial discrimination when he was thrown off a train despite holding a
			  valid first-class ticket. This incident motivated him to fight against racial injustice.
              Formation of Satyagraha (1906): Gandhi developed the concept of Satyagraha, or non-violent resistance, during his time in 
			  South Africa. He led several successful campaig
                   One of the most iconic moments in India's independence movement was the Salt March or Dandi March in 1930. Gandhi and his 
				   followers marched 240 miles to the coastal town of Dandi to make salt, defying British laws that prohibited Indians from 
				   producing their own salt. This act of civil disobedience garnered worldwide attention and highlighted Gandhi’s leadership.
              </li>
			  <li><b>Quit India Movement (1942):</b>
                    During World War II, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, demanding an end to British rule in India. The movement, 
					although suppressed by the British, intensified the demand for independence and led to widespread protests and strikes 
					across the country.
                </li>
               <li><b>Partition and Assassination (1947-1948):</b>
                     In 1947, India gained independence, but Gandhi was deeply saddened by the partition of India and Pakistan, which led to
					 communal violence. Despite his efforts for Hindu-Muslim unity, the violence continued. On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was
					 assassinated by Nathuram Godse, who opposed his efforts for reconciliation.
                     These moments were "surgical" in that they marked significant shifts in both Gandhi's strategies and the broader Indian
					 struggle for independence, shaping the political landscape of India. </li>
